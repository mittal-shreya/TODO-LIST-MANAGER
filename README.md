# TODO-LIST-MANAGER
The To-Do list application serves as a practical platform for users to create, organize, and track their tasks and activities. By integrating different Scheduling Algorithms, traditionally used by Operating Systems to manage processes, this project aims to optimize the scheduling of tasks within the To-Do list application. Through this innovative approach, users can experience improved task prioritization, resource allocation, and overall system responsiveness.
This project explores a diverse range of Scheduling Algorithms, each with its unique advantages and use cases. By implementing algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling, the To-Do list application can cater to various user preferences and requirements. Users can choose the scheduling algorithm that aligns with their task management needs, allowing for a customized and tailored experience.
